'''Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.'''


Code:
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        p=0
        if len(s)==0:
            return p
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        i=0
        j=0
        while j<len(s) and i<len(g):
            if s[j]>=g[i]:
                p+=1
                i+=1
                j+=1
            else:
                j+=1
        return p
